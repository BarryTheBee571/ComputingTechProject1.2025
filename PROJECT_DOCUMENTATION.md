## <ins>**Project Proposal**<ins>
### **1. Design Brief**
The project that I aim to create will be based on the book Murtagh by Christopher Paolini, a book that occurs after the original Eragon/ Inheritance Cycle series. The project will be designing an interactive website in which users can use to find descriptions, lore, maps and information about the characters, locations and background of the book. The target audience would be people that just need a bit more understanding of the large variety of characters and locations, or just picking up the book and needing a refresher on the events that happened in the original series.

### **2. Book Choice and Justification**
The book, Murtagh by Christopher Paolini,  is a fantasy, similar to the style The Lord of the Rings written by JRR Tolkien. Set in the world of Alagaësia with Elves living in the woodland region named Du Weldenvarden to the north, Urgals (Orcs) living in the mountain range named The Spine that covers the west coast and Dwarves that reside in the Beor mountains which reaches above the range that the eyes can see. 
#### **Blurb**
In a world fraught with danger, Dragon Rider Murtagh and his dragon, Thorn, face the consequences of their reluctant role in the reign of a toppled evil king. Now outcast and despised, they navigate the fringes of society. As whispers of looming danger and faint traces of brimstone invade the air, Murtagh senses a sinister force in Alagaësia's shadows. Embarking on an epic journey through both familiar and unexplored lands, Murtagh and Thorn must use all their wit and strength to confront a mysterious witch who is much more than she appears. In this compelling tale from Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, Murtagh seeks to uncover his true identity in a world that has abandoned him. Murtagh is an enthralling adventure for both new and returning fans of the World of Eragon.
#### **Justification**
I have chosen this book as it has vast amount of lore, backgrounds and information that can be explored if someone has forgotten. I also think that this series of books is really good and actually enjoyable to read, therefore making me actually reading it and not just read a few chapters and leave it. This type of book also would be perfect for a wiki because of it’s large universe.

### **3. User Experience Type**
The format of this project will be in a website format as this makes the most sense, you could access it from any device connected to the internet (if this ever goes public). In this format it will enhance the usability of the project as the information and images would be easy to access and more efficient in allowing the user to find the thing they desire.
_________________________________________________________________________
### **4. Target Market**
The target audience for this project will be people who enjoy books like Lord of the Rings, so a wide range of age groups would be interested in this book and would therefore possibly be using this project. If they do decide to use this project to aid themselves with understanding more of the lore and background behind the events and book in general. A website would also cater to most of the audience as the most you’d need would be the access to a browser and the internet to go onto the website and collect the necessary information.

### **5. Software and Tools**
The software platform that i’ll be using will be AdobeXD as this  is one the easier tools to use and I somewhat know how to use it. AdobeXD would be perfect as this would allow me to visualise how it would look as well as how it’ll function when finished.

### **6. Initial Brainstorming**

The key themes that this project will be surrounded on will be based on efficiently displaying information, with design elements that simplify navigation and makes it look pretty. The design of this should make the website look visually appealing, and make it easy to navigate and process for the human eye and brain.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
#### **Performance**
The ideal outcome of performance for the website will be that it has barely any to none input delay and loading times unless it's a page with a heavy amount of images. For example
